              Apollo Program lasted 9 years from initiation to moon landing.
              While a lot happened in the US during World War II, it's easy to
              forget how short the period in question was: American involvement
              lasted 3 years 8 months and 23 days.

            <p><b>How do we help more experimental cities get started?</b></p>
            <p>
              It seems that the returns to entrepreneurialism in cities remain
              high:

              appear much more contingent than inevitable. Maybe there could be
              far more of them. Beyond the direct benefits, city-sized areas
              enable regulatory experimentation that may, in turn, affect much
              larger regions. The

              <b>Why are there so many successful startups in Stockholm?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
              London and Paris have surprisingly few successful tech startups
              for their size. Stockholm, a city of less than 1 million people,
              has Spotify, King, Klarna, iZettle, and Mojang, all valued at more
              than $1 billion. What's true of Stockholm that isn't true of other
              European cities? (Similar questions apply to Provo, Utah, and
              Tallinn, Estonia.)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <b
                >Why are so many things so much nicer in Switzerland and
                Japan?</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Compared to almost all countries (including the US), Switzerland
              and Japan seem to possess much higher baseline execution quality
              in almost everything. Buses and trains are better (and more
              punctual); low-end food is tastier; cheap hotels are more
              comfortable; their airlines score higher on international indexes
              (despite not spending more per passenger); streets are cleaner;
              grocery stores and corner stores are nicer; ostensibly
              unremarkable villages have more beautiful buildings and are more
              pleasant places to spend a few days.
            </p>
            <p>
              (This phenomenon, whatever it is, may extend even further. The
              homicide rates in both Japan and Switzerland are about a tenth of
              that of the US and less than half those of England, France, and
              Germany.)
            </p>

            <p>
              What's going on? While wealth is clearly some of the story, it
              isn't just a matter of wealth: GDP per capita in Japan
              substantially lags that of the US. Nor does it seem to be a matter
              of <i>historical</i> wealth. (1900 Japan was even further behind.)
              It doesn't seem to be the simple result of long periods of
              stability. (Again, Japan.)
            </p>

            <p>
              So, what exactly is this effect? Which things are truly better and
              by how much? Are these effects the result of the same kind of
              phenomenon in Switzerland and Japan? Is this in any way related to
              their
              <a

                >topping</a
              >
              the economic complexity index? Could other countries acquire this
              "general execution capital"? And are there meaningful trade-offs
              involved or is it a kind of free lunch?

            <p><b>Why don't we build nice neighborhoods any more?</b></p>

            <p>
              There are lots of nice neighborhoods in the world. Indeed, almost
              every city has a few of them. But as you happily walk around the
              hutongs in Beijing, Higashiyama in Kyoto, Starówka in Warsaw,
              Palermo in Buenos Aires, Gemmayze in Beirut, or the Village in New
              York, you notice: they are all old. Indeed, we assume by default
              that the "old town" is the nice part, almost always helpfully
              accentuated with ochre shade in Google Maps.
            </p>

            <p>
              Shouldn't this seem weird? Our best computers are not our oldest
              ones. One might immediately suspect survivorship bias --
              presumably we just demolished the bad old neighborhoods and kept
              the good ones. That doesn't seem quite right, though. It's hard to
              think of <i>any</i> neighborhoods in the US constructed since 1950
              that are pleasant, but there are plenty that date from the 17th
              century (Cambridge MA or Providence RI), despite quite a lot less
              construction happening back then. If it's just a selection effect,
              the difference shouldn't be quite so stark.
            </p>

            <p>
              Maybe we got worse at making them as a result of optimizing for

              >
              case that bad urban design predates its invention, however, and
              it's a little hard to imagine that the problem could be so neatly
              monocausal. If so, though, you then have to wonder -- are the
              dynamics that yielded bad design in Toledo OH (his example) the
              same as those at play in recently-constructed urban landscapes,
              like much of Cebu, Philippines?
            </p>

            <p>
              Whatever is going on, a growing fraction (about 55% today) of a
              growing number of humans live in cities. Given that our physical
              location determines so much of our quality of life, shouldn't we
              be very distressed that we seem to be getting <i>worse</i> at
              making them? And what else are we getting worse at?

            <p><b>What's going on with infrastructure?</b></p>
            <p>
              When New York decided to build a subway, the first contract was
              awarded on February 21, 1900. 28 stations opened and general
              operation commenced on October 27, 1904, 4.7 years later. The
              total cost was about $1.1 billion in 2019 dollars. (<a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Wheels-That-Drove-York-Transportation/dp/3642304834"
                >Source</a
              >.) In April 2000, the MTA decided to build the Second Avenue
              Subway. The first phase, with 3 stations, opened on January 1,
              2017; it cost $4.45 billion. Despite construction technology
              having presumably improved in the intervening century, the Second
              Avenue line was 37x more expensive on a per-station basis.
            </p>

            <p>
              The early days of the US Interstate Highway System saw a
              construction cost of about $1.5M per mile in 2019 dollars. (<a
                href="https://www.transportation.gov/testimony/celebrating-50-years-eisenhower-interstate-highway-system"
                >Source</a
              >.) San Francisco currently projects that a
              <a
                href="https://www.sfmta.com/projects/van-ness-improvement-project"
                >bus lane</a
              >
              will cost $309.3 million over 2.2 miles, i.e. $140M per mile. This
              isn't quite like-for-like (SF is merely making some improvements
              in a readily-accessed urban environment, not constructing
              <i>de novo</i> highway), but is nonetheless paying 93x more per
              mile.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most people know that infrastructure is getting more expensive.

              have some good writing on the topic.) The magnitude of the change
              is quite startling, however. If technology is about doing more
              with less, our <i>effective</i> technology for manipulating the
              physical world seems to have drastically deteriorated. In 2019,
              construction of a single high-speed rail link seems slightly
              beyond the boundary of what's possible for California, a state
              with a GDP approximately equal to that of France.

            <p>
              Will this trend continue? Will we lose the ability to even
              maintain what we have today? Is this the product of one factor or
              many? Which countries are exceptions to this trend? What is going
              on?
