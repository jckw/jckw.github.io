          Hey, I'm Jack. I'm the founding software engineer at Outro Health, a
          virtual clinic specialising in evidence-based antidepressant
          deprescription. I've also worked as a tech lead, designer, product

            Continuum is a minimal iOS app and widget that shows you the % of
            your day that has passed and the % of your day that is left.

            I built it as a way to learn SwiftUI and as a simple reminder to
            myself that I have more time in my day than I realise, and that I
            can make use of it.

            Pints.wtf is a viral website that ranks drinks in Wetherspoons pubs
            by their value for alcohol.
          </p>

            It's been used by over 100K users since its launch and was featured

          <p>
            To make it, I reverse-engineered the Wetherspoons app to access
            drink price data, and used a simple Flask server to calculate the
            ranking (unit alcohol per GBP) for any given pub.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly, in 2021 I forgot to update my expired credit card info on the
            domain registrar and the site was unjustly sold on auction. To this
            day, I am still bitter about that (2021 - Present).
          </p>
          <p>
            I rebuilt the site with Next.js and tRPC in 2023 and relaunched the
            website at
