            Continuum is a minimal iOS app and widget that shows you the % of
            your day that has passed and the % of your day that is left.

          <p>
            I built it as a way to learn SwiftUI and as simple reminder to
            myself that I have more time in my day than I realise, and that I
            can make use of it.

            Pints.wtf is a viral website that ranks drinks in Wetherspoons pubs
            by their value for alcohol.

            I reverse engineered the Wetherspoons app to access drink price
            data, and use a simple Flask server to calculate the ranking (unit
            alcohol per GBP) for any given pub.

            Sadly, in 2021 I forgot to update my expired credit card info on the
            domain registrar and the site was unjustly sold on auction. To this
            day, I am still bitter about that (2021 - Present).

            Movemaison was a platform to find student housing in Oxford. It
            attempted to address the difficulty students had in exploring a
            range of housing options from different estate agents due to poor
            user-experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was originally designed to also function as a review platform of
            estate agents and landlords. It was a great learning exercise and
            let me explore a lot of technologies for the first time.

            Breathewise was the end result of a group project as part of the
            Computer Science course at Oxford. I led a team of 5 CS undergrads
            to develop a application to visualise pollution levels across London
            based on data from an API provided by our sponsor,
