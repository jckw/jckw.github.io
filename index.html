          Hey, I'm Jack. I'm the founding software engineer at Outro Health, a
          virtual clinic helping Americans taper off of antidepressants safely.
          I've also worked as a tech lead, designer, product lead, and
          consultant for a number of startups.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm interested in solving human-scale problems with the use of
          technology. I'm also the director of Weekend Systems Ltd. — a product
          studio based in London specialising in doing exactly that.

            until is a new funding model for open-source software that makes it
            possible for small and medium-sized projects to receive ad hoc
            funding in the form of reverse-bounties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Library users can create bounties to incentivise the development of
            features, bug fixes, and documentation. When users donate to a
            bounty, they can set an expiry date after which they will
            automatically receive a refund. Library maintainers can claim the
            bounty by completing the work and submitting an approval request to
            fundbit.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think until could potentially solve the funding problem for
            open-source. It's not in active development any more, but I still
            love the concept.

            Continuum is a minimal iOS app and widget that shows you the % of
            your day that has passed and the % of your day that is left.

          <p>
            I built it as a way to learn SwiftUI and as a simple reminder to
            myself that I have more time in my day than I realise, and that I
            can make use of it.

          <p>
            To make it, I reverse-engineered the Wetherspoons app to access
            drink price data, and used a simple Flask server to calculate the
            ranking (unit alcohol per GBP) for any given pub.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sadly, in 2021 I forgot to update my expired credit card info on the
            domain registrar and the site was unjustly sold on auction. To this
            day, I am still bitter about that (2021 - Present).
          </p>
          <p>
            I rebuilt the site with Next.js and tRPC in 2023 and relaunched the
            website at
