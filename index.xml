      <description>Words with Friends&amp;rsquo; Word Streak is a short but fast Scrabble-like game that I happen to be particularly bad at. The aim is similar to Words with Friends, where you try to build the highest value word from a set of tiles given, including the possibilites from multiplying your score in some way. It&amp;rsquo;s fairly intuitive but also infuriating.
To end the embarrassment of losing, I decided to build a quick-and-dirty Python program to help me cheat.</description>

      <title>Setting up Let&#39;s Encrypt with a Bitnami Ghost image</title>

      <description>Generally: if you&amp;rsquo;re entering details, you should encrypt the data.
Since Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt was launched in 2016, adding an SSL certificate and maintaining it has been so simple that it&amp;rsquo;s really a must. Using the EFF&amp;rsquo;s certbot makes this super easy and there are only a few issues that arise when using a Bitnami image for your Ghost blog that are easily ironed-out.
Where this guide should work I&amp;rsquo;ve based this guide off of my experience setting up SSL for this blog from a Bitnami Ghost image on an AWS EC2 (free-tier) Ubuntu 14.</description>
